You are now acting as an image annotator. I will give you several abstract descriptions which refer to the same object which may appear in the given image and you need to locate them if they exists.

Now I will provide you with two images featuring exactly the same scene but annotated with vertical and horizontal visual segmentation prompt.

One image is divided into <<9>> segments using up-to-down lines, and the other one is divided with left-to-right lines into <<9>> segments. Each segment is labeled with a number from 1 to <<segment_density>>.

--- THINK FIRST (PRIVATE, DO NOT OUTPUT) ---
Before doing anything else, perform a silent reasoning pass ONLY for CATEGORY & LOCATION inference:
- Consolidate the multiple question hints into exactly ONE canonical target category (singular, "<adj+noun>" if applicable). Resolve synonyms; pick the most likely name. If multiple instances exist, choose the single most probable one the questions jointly refer to.
- use your knowledge about the common features of the target and common camouflaged patterns
- Localize this single target by hypothesizing which numbered grid segments contain ANY part of it (favor recall at boundaries; include partial touches). Consider camouflage, occlusion, low contrast, and background confusion.
- If the target is not present, determine that confidently.
DO NOT reveal or print any of these internal thoughts anywhere. They are for your internal guidance only.
--- END THINK FIRST ---

Now please carefully follow the below instruction step by step:
1. Infer what is (are) the objects that the questions are jointly referring to, carefully review the given image and find the object(s) that is the most probable candidate(s). (Exactly one category should be decided.)
2. Denote from which labeled segment to which contain any parts of the object(s) that the questions described, both vertically and horizontally. Include ALL segment numbers that contain ANY part of the target, even if tiny or on the border.

Tell me these segment ids in json as follows:

{  
"instance": "<words(adj+noun) short summarative description of the answer object>",  
"ids_line_vertical": [1,2,3,...],  
"ids_line_horizontal": [1,2,3,...],  
"reason": "your rationale about what is(are) being referred"  
}

Attention: you MUST give all segment numbers that contain any parts of the object(s) that the questions described. The answer object may not be the salient object in the frame, and may even not appear in the frame.

If the answer is not in the image, please return empty ids like:

{  
"instance": "<words(adj+noun) short summarative description of the answer object>",  
"ids_line_vertical": [],  
"ids_line_horizontal": [],  
"reason": "your rationale about what is being referred and why none of the object in the scene matches"  
}

Output RULES:
- Output ONLY the JSON object specified above. No extra text, no explanations, no markdown fences.
- Keys must be exactly: instance, ids_line_vertical, ids_line_horizontal, reason.
- Exactly ONE category in "instance".

Now, the questions are presented as follows, do NOT output anything other than the required json.
