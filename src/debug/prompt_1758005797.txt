I need you to analyze this segmentation image and select anchors to improve the mask for 'camouflaged scorpionfish'.

The image shows numbered anchor points (1-8) around a green mask overlay. Your task: choose which anchors need refinement.

Return EXACTLY this JSON format:
{
  "anchors_to_refine": [
    { "id": 1, "intent": "fix_leak", "reason": "brief reason" },
    { "id": 3, "intent": "recover_miss", "reason": "brief reason" }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Use anchor ids 1-8 only
- Intent: "fix_leak" (green spills to background) or "recover_miss" (missing target parts)
- Select 1-3 anchors maximum
- Keep reasons short (no quotes inside text)

Example response:
{"anchors_to_refine":[{"id":2,"intent":"fix_leak","reason":"background intrusion"},{"id":6,"intent":"recover_miss","reason":"missing edge"}]}
